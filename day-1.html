  <h1> JavaScript 1 </h1>
  <p> When we make a webpage, JavaScript can go into a &lt;script&gt; tag. One big part of JavaScript is called
    "imperative programming." This means that you are creating commands telling the computer what to do. The first
    "command" we will learn is </p>
  <p>
    <code> document.write("Hello"); </code>
  </p>

  <p>P.S. (The proper way to say "command" is "statement". JavaScript programs are composed of a series of JavaScript
    "statements")</p>

  <h3>Examples</h3>
  <p> Let's start with some examples!</p>
  <script>
    document.write("Hello from JavaScript! ");
    document.write("I am telling you... ");
    document.write("don't forget the quotation marks! ");
    document.write("Every single letter and character is important. ");
    document.write('Very important. ');


  </script>

  <h3>You try it!</h3>
  <p>Now you try! Fill out the 3 <code>document.write();</code> statements below with your own text. Then write 5 more
    statements of your own, for a total of 8! </p>
  <script>
    document.write("Backstreet's back! ");
    document.write("Who do you love? ");
    document.write("are you for sure? ");
    document.write("dreaming of you! ");
    document.write("I am whatever you say I am! ");
    document.write("Say my name! ");
    document.write("Amazing grace! " );
    document.write("How sweet the sound! ");


  </script>
